Hardware package
================

The hardware namespace has two part, a drivers and an encoder. The drivers control the actuators and provide an interface for low level functionality of sensors.
The 'encoder' namespace implements the rotary speed encoder, while the lower level pulse counter is described in the 'drivers' namespace.
